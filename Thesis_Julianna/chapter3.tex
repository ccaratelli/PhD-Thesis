{Major research results}
\label{ch3}
Within this Chapter the main research results obtained within the framework of
this thesis will be presented. The main goal was the study of defects and active
sites within UiO--66. Various reactions were considered, such as
citronellal cyclization, aldol condensation, Oppenauer oxidation and Fischer
esterification in
collaboration with experimental partners (Figure \ref{fig:reactionmechanisms},
Chapter 1).
To obtain a correct mechanistic view on each of these reactions, it is essential to properly account for the complexity.
Complexity may entail effects like framework
flexibility, influence of solvent and dynamic change of the nature of active
sites. In some cases it was sufficient to model the reaction steps using
periodic DFT calculations in a static approach.
During the time frame of the PhD it became possible and necessary to go beyond this approach
and explicitly study the dynamics of the system including the effect of other
guest species and temperature. In this Chapter, the most
significant results and conclusions of the corresponding papers are highlighted.
More details can be found in the original articles, which are enclosed in Part
II.

\section{Open metal sites due to structural defects in UiO--66}
The UiO--66 material is a showcase example of an extremely stable MOF, which
maintains its integrity while allowing structural deformations during
activation processes. For UiO--66, recent discoveries have
revealed that after defect engineering the material possesses not only Lewis acid sites but also a substantial amount of Br\o{}nsted sites which show
remarkable chemical behavior in the form of dynamic acidity and may take an
interactive role in reactions where proton transfers are necessary (Figure
\ref{fig:lewisbronsted}).
The findings presented in this Chapter could be extended to other Zr based MOFs
to understand their properties and fine--tune these materials to obtain
target catalytic functions.

\subsection*{Effect of modulator}
The strength of MOFs is their versatility and their potential to be tuned for a
given application. Specifically for UiO--66 different synthesis procedures were
used to alter the chemical structure of the material. In
particular, during the MOF preparation, monocarboxylic acids which are in
competition with bi- or polycipital linkers to coordinate to the metal sites can
prevent the connection between two inorganic bricks, creating linker
deficiencies \cite{Vermoortele2013}.
Experimentally UiO--66 was synthesized using different modulation approaches and the effect of the type and amount of modulator added during synthesis was perceived to determine the degree to which structural defects are created \cite{Vermoortele2013, Shearer2016, Cliffe2014, Morris2017mod}. From a theoretical viewpoint in
\textbf{Paper I}, we investigated the role of modulating species such as
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and water in the creation and stabilization of linker vacancies \cite{Vandichel2015}. By constructing free energy diagrams, we found that during the synthesis of UiO--66 with an excess concentration of TFA in the reaction mixture, the Zr atoms may adsorb two TFA groups instead of one BDC linker. This
project was performed in a close collaboration with the group of Prof. Dirk De
Vos in which these features were observed experimentally. We further showed that
the presence of HCl facilitates the formation of defects which was also seen in
the Fourier--transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) by DeCoste \textit{et
al.}\cite{DeCoste2013}. Furthermore, at the low temperature synthesis, below 423
K, the addition of hydrochloric acid enables the replacement of hydroxyl groups
in the inorganic node by incorporation of chloride anions. As can be seen in
Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper1a}, the formation of linker defects is certainly not thermodynamically driven, but the addition of modulators such as TFA or HCl lowers the free energy required for the formation of linker deficiency. The amount of defects can be
concentration driven, and expands with increasing amount of a modulator
concentration, which is in competition with BDC. Furthermore, postsynthetic
activation procedures at elevated temperatures result in substantial removal of the capping ligands,
leaving more coordinatively unsaturated Zr Lewis acid sites. This concept can be
extended to other MOFs.

\subsection*{Dehydration mechanism of UiO-66}
Dehydration of UiO--66 occurs at elevated temperature in the range between 523
- 573 K.
The entropy driven activation conditions promote the dehydration process of the material, which results in the removal of water from the inorganic
brick, and is schematically shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper1b}. For the
first time the mechanistic pathway for the initial dehydration process of the
inner \ce{Zr6O4(OH4)} brick of UiO--66 was proposed in \textbf{Paper I} and the reaction was studied on the material with one missing linker with unit cell formula 
\ce{[Zr6O4(OH)4(RCOO)12][Zr6O6(OH)2(RCOO)10]} \cite{Vandichel2015}.

A two--step procedure was applied to gain a profound molecular insight into
this process and involved intermediate structures. Initially, the energy
surface was explored by performing a series of MD simulations based on
NPT ensemble with variable volume at a pressure of $10^{-9}$
bar. The initial structure for the MD was chosen to have the hydroxyl groups
ordered in a fully symmetrical way representing the lowest energetically
configuration for UiO--66. During simulations, the temperature was gradually
increased to gain structural insight into temperature--induced distortions which
lead to dehydration. The most common distortion pattern which was observed along the MD
trajectory showed simultaneous decoordination of a 
\ce{{\textmu}3}--OH hydroxyl group together with one BDC linker, 
and was taken as an initial structure for the following static geometry optimizations. Subsequently, 
the electronic energy profile was obtained after performing a series of NEB
simulations between initial and end structure (Chapter \ref{ch2}). The potential
energy surface reveals the appearance of two transition states and some
metastable configurations as displayed in Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper1c}.
As it was deduced form the MD simulations, the process was initiated by the
\ce{{\textmu}1}--OH hydroxyl group configuration and decoordinated BDC linker.
The hydroxyl group changes its coordination from 3 (\ce{{\textmu}3}--OH) to 1
(\ce{{\textmu}1}-OH) by traveling to another site of the inorganic brick and
subsequently undergoes protonation with another \ce{{\textmu}3}--OH hydroxyl
group to form water. The highest point on the profile which corresponds to a first transition state is encountered in structure 7. In this configuration one linker is decoordinated with the
carboxylic oxygen from the Zr atom and the hydroxyl group is detached from two
Zr atoms. After that, some intermediate, metastable structures are observed,
where the linker is in the chelated state being coordinated with two O atoms
to the same Zr atom (structure 12). When the decoordinated hydroxyl
group is on the other side of the inorganic brick, the linker recoordinates to the parent position (structure 20). This configuration represents a local minimum on the potential energy surface. Subsequently, the released hydroxyl group abstracts a proton of another available 
\ce{{\textmu}3}--OH group (structure 23), which results in the formation of a
water molecule (structure 27) and partly dehydrated inorganic brick. It should
be noted that the studied UiO--66 structure can undergo two additional
dehydration reactions (Figure
\ref{fig:figure_Paper1b}), which were further investigated in \textbf{Paper II}.
Moreover, the presence of missing linkers can also affect this process
substantially.

\subsection*{Effect of missing linkers on dehydration}
A thorough understanding of the influence of various linker deficiency in
UiO--66 on the dehydration mechanism at reaction conditions was reported in
\textbf{Paper II} \cite{Vandichel2016}. A total of six defect structures
were generated with a different number and position of missing linkers.
The dehydration mechanism remains the same for all structures. However,
the influence of defects on the dehydration processes is yet unknown and it is very
challenging to study this effect experimentally. To obtain a molecular insight
into the dehydration mechanism of the six different structures of UiO--66 the
same methodology as in the \textbf{Paper I} was applied making use of
NEB calculations.
As discussed earlier, the dehydration of the material occurs at elevated
temperature. To account for the thermal corrections, all local minima and
transition states were further optimized employing a stronger convergence
criterion for the electronic self--consistent field (SCF) problem. The vibrational mode analysis was then performed on the
stationary points by computing full Hessian frequency calculations. In this
context we described structural deformations, therefore a full Hessian
approach, with frequency calculations that include all the atoms, was required
to properly account for the entropic contribution. Only positive eigenvalues were seen for minima, while for transition states the presence of one negative eigenvalue corresponding to the right normal mode verified that the system was in a first order saddle point.
For all 12--fold coordinated bricks the removal of the second water molecule is
higher activated than the first one. The endothermic nature of the dehydration
process was also confirmed experimentally by Shearer \textit{et
al.}\cite{Shearer2013}. Herein, it was found that water removal becomes easier
and the process is lower activated when defects are located nearby pointing out that they might be correlated.
\npar
In \textbf{Paper I}, we postulated the
dehydration reaction as a two--step process which proceeds through the
intermediate dangling OH--groups (configuration 20, Figure
\ref{fig:figure_Paper1c}). Shearer \textit{et
al.}\cite{Shearer2013} performed
\textit{in situ} IR experiment in which the temperature was gradually increased
and observed the presence of extra OH bands appearing at 3600--3700
cm\ce{^-^1}. This clearly indicates structural rearrangements during thermal
activation. Theoretically obtained \textit{ab initio} IR spectrum on the cluster
model of UiO-66 with a decoordinated, dangling OH group demonstrates that the stretching
mode frequency of the hydroxyl group shifts to lower wavenumbers,
entirely confirming experimental observations (Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper2a}).

\newpage
It may be anticipated that introducing a large
concentration of defects has also a large impact on the mechanical properties of the
material. Recently Yot \textit{et al.}\cite{Yot2016} investigated the
mechanical behavior of UiO--66 by means of high-pressure powder
X-Ray diffraction studies up to 3.5 GPa. It was observed that the
material showed a gradual pressure--induced reversible decrease of
crystallinity. The bulk modulus of the material was determined to be 17 GPa and
by introducing amino functionalization this value even 
increased to 25 GPa. This observation points
towards a high mechanical robustness of the UiO-66 type of materials on top of
their already well known thermal and chemical stability. However, the detailed
effect of the amount and correlation of missing linkers in the material was not
explored. From theoretical point of view Wu \textit{et al.}\cite{Wu2013} reported, using
periodic DFT calculations the bulk modulus of 41 GPa for the defect free UiO--66
structure. Hereby, for each of the proposed defect structures we investigated
the bulk modulus, to elucidate the influence of a varying number of linker
deficiencies on the mechanical behavior. Our results showed that bulk modulus is
strongly affected by the number of missing linkers but also the precise position
of the defects, which was also observed in a later, more extensive study by
Rogge \textit{et al.}\cite{Rogge2016}.
In \textbf{Paper II} we also investigated the evolution of the bulk modulus on
the dehydrated structures of UiO--66 proving that this process barely affects
the robustness of UiO--66.

\newpage
\subsection*{Inherent flexibility of UiO--66}
In \textbf{Paper III}, we made a major step forward in the structural understanding of the
inert Zr--based MOFs, by using enhanced sampling MD simulations
which accelerate sampling of higher activated regions on the free energy 
surface. Application of theses methods allow following \textit{in situ} the
fast dynamic changes in the coordination number of the framework metals during
different activation processes which are realized experimentally. The UiO--66
material is a showcase example of an extremely stable MOF, 
which maintains its integrity while allowing structural deformations during
activation processes such as linker exchange, dehydration and defects
formation \cite{Kim2012a, Kim2012, Horike2009, Leus2016}. Recently, by using
ultrafast 2--D IR spectroscopy, structural fluctuations were shown in
functionalized Zr--based MOFs \cite{Nishida2014}, yet the understanding at a
molecular level of the intrinsic dynamics that drive these processes represents a puzzle which is almost impossible to fully solve on a purely experimental basis.
Hereby, we used the US methodology to enhance the sampling of low probability
regions along certain coordinates of the system. We showed that by examining the UiO-66 system at 573 K, thus at the
dehydration temperature of this material,
the coordination number of the hydroxyl group bridging the Zr atoms of the
inorganic brick changes from 3 to 1 (Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper3a}). During
this process internal deformation modes were detected pointing to reversible linker decoordination.
We defined the collective variable by means of the coordination number based on
the distance between the hydroxyl group and the three surrounding Zr atoms, as
schematically shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper3a}. With this choice, during
the simulations we discriminated five classes of configurations which vary in
the degree of coordination of the hydroxyl group with Zr
atoms going from a 3--fold to a 1--fold coordination, as displayed in Figure
\ref{fig:figure_Paper3a} \cite{Hajek2018}. A first exploration of the reaction
path characterized by this CV has been
performed by means of a constrained MD simulation. This constrained MD method
takes the form of a moving umbrella which during the whole duration of the MD
crosses the entire range of CV with a constant velocity. In this simulation, a bias potential is moved smoothly along the reaction
coordinate to drive the system from the reactant to the product state at the same
conditions. This is a crucial step in the US methodology which allows selecting
of the various windows on the reaction path along the CV and determining the
initial structures in each of these windows.

\end{figure}
\npar
Configuration 1 at 573 K corresponds to the equilibrium structure.
In this case, each of the six Zr atoms in the brick is 8--fold
coordinated an the four \ce{{\textmu}3}--OH groups are ordered
symmetrically in a tetrahedral fashion. Activation of the system towards configuration 2 requires
20 kJ/mol of free energy. From the analysis of the US simulations we can obtain more
information on the type of connection between the oxygen and the three Zr atoms
by inspecting the probability distributions for each of
the configurations. In the pristine UiO--66, the relatively mobile nature of the
\ce{{\textmu}3}--OH group is displayed by a loosely connected
OH--bond with one of the Zr atoms, which is equally distributed between the three Zr atoms. Furthermore,
the dehydration process is initiated by configuration 2, as a subsequent
evolution towards lower coordination numbers does not reveal any
\ce{{\textmu}3}--OH configurations. In configuration 3 the
hydroxyl group is covalently bonded to only one of the Zr atoms, but
additionally it maintains the coordination bond with one of the two remaining Zr
atoms.
This is a crucial point along the reaction path where we see for the first
time the elongation in the M--L bond and out--of--plane deformation of the
phenyl ring. These explain the increased free energy and give a clear
indication that the system enters the transition state region. The broad set of
structures encountered after configuration 3 possesses substantial linker
mobility. The internal deformation modes in the configuration of type 4 include
linker decoordination, translation, rotation and recoordination and are observed
for the four linkers bonded to the same Zr atom. In Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper3b} two possible
motions of the BDC linker are displayed.

\npar
The first motion illustrates the
translation of the linker along the axis of the two Zr atoms to which it is
bonded (Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper3b}, left column). In this case the intermediary chelated structure
was perceived. The second motion which is schematically shown in the right
column of Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper3b} 
corresponds to a rotation mode along the \ce{Zr-O} bond. The direct consequence
of rotation of this linker is the decoordination of another linker which is
bonded to the same Zr atom. This second linker is immediately coordinated to the
nearest \ce{{\textmu}3}--OH gaining the stabilization due to a proton shuttle between the hydroxyl group and the carboxylic oxygen of
the linker. Such proton shuttles may also be
facilitated by the presence of other guest species in the pores, such as
methanol (\textbf{Paper VIII}). These results expand the earlier concept of
dynamic acidity introduced by Ling and Slater \cite{Ling2016} and in
\textbf{Paper II} in the defective UiO--66 to defect--free material where guest
protic species are not present. Configurations of type 5 are characterized by the hydroxyl group being in a \ce{{\textmu}1}--OH
configuration. In this part of the simulations the system undergoes fast
structural fluctuations which are rationalized by a combination of the two
earlier described motions of translation and rotation on a multidimensional free
energy plateau at about 90 kJ/mol. The complex intrinsic dynamic flexibility of the framework is shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper3c}.

\npar
During the translation, rotation and combination of these two
deformation modes, which are observed for configurations of type 4 and 5, we
also saw substantial rearrangements of the coordination numbers of the various Zr
atoms. The change in the coordination numbers of Zr can easily vary between 8
and 6. This is directly connected to a remarkable intrinsic dynamic behavior of
the system, where neighboring linkers decoordinate and are 
stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with adjacent hydroxyl groups.
Another important aspect is that linkers have the ability to reversibly
decoordinate and coordinate to the Zr atoms being responsible for the
extraordinary stability of the UiO--66 material, which is undoubtedly related to the oxophilic character of the metal ion. This study in which the activation
process is entropically driven might eventually also lead to the
formation of water, thus dehydration of UiO--66. All the activated processes in
which defects on UiO--66 are formed may have a decisive effect on catalytic
reactions. These defects which create active sites in the material may act as
Lewis acid but also Br\o{}nsted acid or base sites as it has already been shown in literature.
The performance of UiO--66 as a multifunctional catalyst was intensively
investigated in \textbf{Paper IV} and \textbf{Paper V}.


\subsection*{Effect of dehydration on catalysis}
In the dehydration and other processes creating defects, the coordination number
of Zr changes which has a decisive effect on the catalytic properties of the
material. A profound molecular level understanding of these modifications on the
strength of Br\o{}nsted and Lewis acid sites within MOFs is crucial to tune the catalytic
activity for many acid--base catalyzed reactions. In \textbf{Paper IV} detailed
molecular and experimental insights were gained on the influence of the degree
of dehydration on the nature of the active sites in the catalysis of the
Oppenauer oxidation \cite{Hajek2017}.
The hydrated and dehydrated UiO--66 material with one linker defect was
considered as a catalyst involving three different adjacent Zr active sites, as displayed in Figure
\ref{fig:figure_Paper4a}.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figure_Paper4a}
	\caption{Representation of active sites on hydrated and dehydrated UiO--66 and
	Zr--beta zeolite. In each configuration Zr Lewis acid sites
	and Br\o{}nsted base sites are
	encircled.}
	\label{fig:figure_Paper4a}
\end{figure}
\npar
On the Zr--beta zeolite the reaction mechanism of the
reverse MPV reduction of aldehydes to ketones was
unraveled by Boronat \textit{et al.}\cite{Boronat2006}. In the proposed
mechanism well--defined and isolated Lewis acid and Br\o{}nsted base sites were shown to
be involved in the lowest activated reaction path. A schematic representation of the
resemblance between the active sites in UiO--66 and the Zr--beta zeolite is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper4a}.
The reactions where dehydrogenation of alcohols is involved represent an example
in which acid-base centers of intermediate strength are required. Although the
active sites on the Zr--beta zeolite look similar to the one on UiO--66 and the
reaction mechanism of the MPV reduction seems to be rather understandable, 
the role of the acid and base sites and structural modifications in the UiO--66
remain to be investigated for fine--tuning catalytic properties. To
study the influence of both missing linkers and dehydration of the structure on
the catalytic activity and to elucidate the bifunctional, amphoteric nature of
UiO--66, the Oppenauer oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds was chosen as
a model reaction.
The Lewis acid character of differently coordinated Zr atoms was investigated by
means of DFT calculations using furfural, a strong oxidant as a probe molecule.
Surprisingly, the adsorption free energy at 393 K of this molecule on the three
considered active sites varies of about 5 kJ/mol at PBE--D3 level of theory
(Figure \ref{fig:free_energy_oxidation}, configuration 1).
This clearly indicates that the Lewis acid strength of Zr atoms on hydrated and
dehydrated material is preserved. Prenol was chosen as a primary alcohol to be
oxidized to prenal. The co--adsorption of this molecule on adjacent Lewis acid site has almost equal strength on the three considered active sites indicating that the Lewis acidity is not significantly altered between hydrated and dehydrated material. The specific coordination number of Zr has a minor effect on the Lewis acid strength which is distributed over the Zr metal and the bond with the adjacent \ce{{\textmu}3}--O (configuration 2). The next step in the reaction mechanism
represents the transition state of the deprotonation of the alcohol to the
\ce{{\textmu}3}--O atom (Ts1). This step proceeds the fastest on the hydrated
material indicating that it possesses stronger base sites than the dehydrated
UiO-66. The free energy barrier amounts to 7.4 kJ/mol on the active site of the
hydrated material and it increases to 36.7 kJ/mol and 50.9 kJ/mol, on the active
site on the dehydrated UiO-66 7-- and 6--fold coordinated, respectively.
Furthermore, the formed alkoxide is the most strongly stabilized on the hydrated material. From the geometrical analysis of Zr--\ce{{\textmu}3}--O distances we observed that the higher the coordination numbers of the involved
zirconium atoms the more stable the alkoxide becomes. The Lewis acid and
Br\o{}nsted base sites can attractively interact as electrons are less
concentrated between the Zr and \ce{{\textmu}3}--O atoms. In the second
transition state the atoms from the inorganic framework are not directly
involved into the carbon-to-carbon hydride shift between two reacting molecules.
The effects is immediately observed by similar energy barriers for this
transformation on the hydrated and dehydrated UiO--66. The
hydride shift gives rise to prenal, the desired product of the
Oppenauer oxidation (configuration 4). Hereby, the hydrated UiO--66 was found as
a better catalyst than the dehydrated material to facilitate the Oppenauer
oxidation of prenol to prenal with furfural as an oxidative agent. The experimental results
on the influence of both linker vacancies and hydration state of the UiO--66 framework on its catalytic performance confirmed theoretical predictions. A much higher activity was systematically found on the hydrated material. Within this work we showed that the properties of the material can be tuned by the pretreatment procedures and there is a fine cooperation between the Lewis acid and Br\o{}nsted base sites in
the inorganic brick. This study also demonstrates that chemical properties of
UiO--66 are similar to its \ce{ZrO2} precursor.

\subsection*{Influence of water on the active catalytic sites}
The adsorption of water by porous solids and their stability in water
environment is essential for their application in catalysis. In this
respect, chemical and hydrothermal stability of UiO--66 was proved by Leus
\textit{et al.}\cite{Leus2016}. Creation of defects and disorders in the
material occurs during the synthesis, and in this respect, a missing
linker defect in the material can be seen as a removal of one negatively charged
BDC linker. In such a way, a positive charge is created on the brick which has
to be compensated. This can happen either by removing a positively charged
proton, or by adsorbing a negative species such as a hydroxyl group to one of the
coordinatively unsaturated Zr atoms. Experimentally the identification and
characterization of the nature of defects in MOFs on the molecular level remains a very challenging task to
achieve. Within the use of single--crystal X--ray diffraction (SXRD) the
presence of terminating hydroxyl groups and/or coordinating water molecules on the
defect sites of UiO--66 was observed by the group of Lillerud \cite{Oien2014}
and the group of Yaghi \cite{Trickett2015}. Furthermore in the work of Yaghi \textit{et
al.}\cite{Trickett2015}, an additional hydroxide anion per defect site was
perceived to coordinate with a defective \ce{Zr-O-Zr} site. It was postulated that upon
removal of one linker, two adjacent Zr atoms are capped with physisorbed water
molecules and the charge compensating hydroxyl counterion is stabilized by a
hydrogen bond with a neighboring \ce{{\textmu}3}--OH group. In \textbf{Paper II}
we considered different configurations of coordinated water molecules on the
open metal sites to determine the chemical nature of active sites. 
In the simplest case, upon removal of a proton, also two Br\o{}nsted
basic sites are created and these are the two oxo atoms from the framework that
bridge the adjacent Zr atoms. The configuration with coordinatively unsaturated
adjacent Lewis acid sites was taken as the reference structure R (Figure
\ref{fig:figure_Paper2b}). In the latter case, the adsorption of one water
molecule gives rise to an additional Br\o{}nsted acid and base sites, but the
Lewis acid property of Zr is lost. Subsequently, more water molecules can be
coordinated to the open metal sites, and several possibilities have been
screened as reported in Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper2b}. In all structures
various possible Lewis and Br\o{}nsted sites are indicated which may have a
decisive role in a catalytic reaction.

\newpage
The most stable configurations represent the structures of UiO--66 which defect
site is capped by two or three water molecules. The physisorbed water molecule
on the Lewis acid site immediately deprotonates to the \ce{{\textmu}3}--O atom.  
The structure with the chemisorbed hydroxyl group and physisorbed water forms a
strongly stable complex with a free energy difference of -94.4 kJ/mol compared
to reference configuration R. The presence of a third water molecule stabilizes 
this complex slightly more. The last configuration with three water molecules is
indeed some kJ/mol more bonded on the free energy surface at 351 K. This study
is complementary to the work of Ling and Slater \cite{Ling2016}, in which a
detailed understanding into the coordination of water and charge balancing hydroxide ions was obtained by applying an MD approach.
Ling and Slater \cite{Ling2016} showed that the structure proposed by Yaghi and
co--workers \cite{Trickett2015} does not represent energetically the most stable
configuration.
Instead, the hydroxide ion coordinates to the Zr metal while two water molecules
are physisorbed to the oxo and Zr atoms as shown in Figure \ref {fig:figure_Paper2b}. The water stabilization pattern is in agreement with what was observed in this work in
\textbf{Paper II} and \textbf{Paper VII}. However, depending on the
temperature and concentration of water molecules various proton shuttles may
occur proving the dynamic Br\o{}nsted acidity of active sites in UiO--66. The
beneficial influence of water on the reaction cycle of Fischer esterification of
an organic carboxylic acid with methanol was shown in \textbf{Paper VII} in the combined theoretical and experimental work. The mechanism of this reaction was studied on the hydrated
and dehydrated Zr Lewis acid sites of UiO--66. The complementary performance of
Lewis and Br\o{}nsted sites was required to substantially increase the catalytic activity of the material. Moreover, the
experimental data clearly indicated that the catalytic activity dropped upon
removal of physisorbed water from UiO--66, which is in complete agreement with
theoretical model \cite{Caratelli2017}.


\subsection*{Effect of linker functionalization}
In many MOFs catalyzed reactions the observed increased catalytic activity
results from the formation of a large number of accessible active sites or
linker functionalization. Vermoortele \textit{et al.}\cite{Vermoortele2012}
demonstrated that the UiO--66 materials with electron--withdrawing groups
substitution are notably more active for citronellal cyclization. Furthermore,
in another study by Vermoortele \textit{et al.}\cite{Vermoortele2013} it was observed that more accessible pores and large amount of available open metal sites enhance the electronic
effect of the nitro group. In this respect the synthesis
procedures by combine use of TFA and HCl were crucial to modulate the material for desired
applications and strengthen the Lewis acid character of the active sites. To
obtain a profound molecular understanding on the modulation effect of TFA on the
material reactivity we used the citronellal cyclization as a probe reaction for
Lewis acid strength. In this simulation, the extended cluster model with
coordinatively unsaturated adjacent Zr sites surrounded by two terephthalate
linkers and one TFA was used. The remaining four linkers were replaced by
formate groups. In Figure \ref{fig:citronellal} the free energy profile for
conversion of citronellal to isopulegol is shown at 373 K. The
electronic modulation effect of a TFA group on the nitro functionalized
UiO--66(\ce{NO2}) results in stronger adsorption and leads to lower apparent
barriers for the transition and product states when compared to the material
without incorporated modulator and functionalization.

Vermoortele \textit{et al.}\cite{Vermoortele2011} reported the
amino--functionalized UiO--66(\ce{NH2}) as a highly selective catalyst for the cross--aldol
condensation between benzaldehyde and heptanal (Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper5a}). A similar conclusion 
for the acetylisation of benzaldehyde was published by Timofeeva \textit{et
al.}\cite{Timofeeva2014} and for the esterification reactions by Cirujano \textit{et
al.}\cite{Cirujano2015}.

\end{figure}
\npar
The observed increased activity with comparison to the
pristine UiO--66 was explained by the co--catalytic role of amino groups. The
proposed experimental reaction mechanism was not verified on the molecular level,
therefore in \textbf{Paper V} we aimed to obtain in--depth insight into the
active sites for the aldol condensation reaction on the two catalysts,
unraveling the true role of the amino group. The catalytic performance of
UiO--66 and amino--functionalized UiO--66(\ce{NH2}) was evaluated for the
cross-- and self--aldol condensation of propanal and benzaldehyde. To rationalize the
reaction mechanism it was recommended to first use the extended cluster model followed
by periodic calculations for the most probable mechanism. In line with what
was earlier observed for UiO--66, the catalytic activity of this material has
its origin in the presence of defects which are coordinatively unsaturated Lewis
acid sites. For the aldol condensation on UiO--66 we proposed a six steps
mechanism, shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper5b} which is initiated by the
adsorption of two reactants on the adjacent Zr atoms. Furthermore, the
bi--functional nature of UiO--66 was unraveled. To initiate the reaction, propanal was
solely activated by deprotonation of the $\alpha$--carbon atom to the
\ce{{\textmu}3}--O atom, which acts as a Br\o{}nsted
base. We also investigated a pathway in which aldol condensation is initially
Br\o{}nsted acid catalyzed by means of hydroxyl group from the inorganic
framework but found higher free energy barriers \cite{Hajek2015}.

\npar
To examine the catalytic performance of the amino--functionalized material, we
studied the cross--aldol condensation which is initiated by the
adsorption on the adjacent Zr Lewis acid.
Nevertheless, the effects of the amino substitution during different steps in the reaction profile appears to be
negligible, as it only lowers the adsorption of propanal and benzaldehyde. The
strong adsorption of the reactants and the slightly lower activation free energy
barrier for the UiO--66(\ce{NH2}) could point towards a higher activity of this
material compared to the pristine UiO--66 (Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper5b}).
This observation was in agreement with many experimental works dedicated to
condensation reactions in which the systematic increase in activity was obtained
when the material was functionalized by electron--donating amino groups. It was commonly accepted that the cooperative work between the Zr Lewis sites and the amino Br\o{}nsted base sites resulted in high yields for
this type of reactions. In some experimental works the direct role of the amino
group as a base site was proposed \cite{Timofeeva2014, Yang2014, Gascon2009,
Panchenko2014}. In this line, a further detailed theoretical mechanistic
investigation on UiO--66(\ce{NH2}) was performed. The resulting free energy barriers at 393 K are highlighted in Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper5c}. The
deprotonation of propanol to the corresponding carbocation is about 80 kJ/mol higher activated on the amino group as a base site. Moreover the
formation of hemiaminal was also investigated as this is an intermediate
structure in the Knoevenagel condensation \cite{Cortese2011,
Panchenko2014, Yang2014}. For this pathway, the free energy barrier between the
pre--reactive complex and transition state goes up to 205.4 kJ/mol which
indicates that the hydrogen bonding interaction between the amino group and the
carboxyl oxygen of propanal does not reveal catalytic properties (Figure
\ref{fig:figure_Paper5d}). Even though the imine formation is very highly
activated it could happen with assistance of guest species which facilitate the proton shuttle, such as water. Hereby, it was demonstrated that on the
amino--functionalized UiO--66(\ce{NH2}) the imine formation can happen as soon
as water is present on the catalyst (Figure \ref{fig:figure_Paper5d}).

Furthermore, in the jasminaldehyde condensation
water is produced as a side product and could assist in the reaction mechanism
in the steps where proton transfers are involved. In \textbf{Paper VIII} it was
indeed shown that polar protic solvents like methanol form a
hydrogen--bonded network allowing protons to shuttle between the solvent,
adsorbed water and the inorganic brick. As protons can easily shuttle among
various positions on the defective sites, the active sites show a remarkable
dynamic behavior \cite{Caratelli2017a}.
\npar
In the complementary experimental study performed in the group of Prof. Dirk
De Vos the superior initial conversion of propanol which results in the
higher initial selectivity for the cross aldol product on UiO--66(\ce{NH2}) was
also confirmed. However, after prolonged reaction time the experimental data predicts a comparable performance of both catalysts.
\npar
Summarizing, in \textbf{Paper V} we unraveled that amino functionalized BDC
linkers possess an electron--donating character but this group as a base is not
actively involved in the reaction mechanism, indicating that the proposed mechanism of aldol condensation is similar on the
pristine and amino substituted UiO--66.
\npar
These findings are confirmed in \textbf{Paper VII} where it was observed that
amino groups yield a decrease in the reaction barriers which is in alignment
with experimental observations performed in  the group of Dr. Francesc X.
Llabr\'es i Xamena. They have an active and substantial role in modulating the
electronic structure of the material but a passive role in the reaction
mechanism \cite{Caratelli2017}.


\section{Contributions to other articles}
In addition to the main research projects presented in the previous sections, a
small contribution was made to study the nature of active sites in Ca--modified
ZSM--5 for MTO conversion. It concerned a combined
experimental--theoretical \textbf{Paper XI} and is briefly summarized
below \cite{Yarulina2016}.


\subsection*{Acid site modification with Ca}
Within the field of catalysis, many researchers are continuously searching for
suitable modifications of the catalyst to improve its performance, to direct the
product selectivity and to prolong the lifetime of the catalyst. Within the MTO
process it is commonly accepted that there exists a dual--cycle mechanism,
involving the presence of two cycles, a methylation/cracking cycle leading
especially to propylene production and an aromatic cycle, responsible for
ethylene and aromatics formation. The latter feature is responsible for catalyst
deactivation. The aromatics formation can be suppressed by a combination of a
decreased number and strength of acid sites and an altered accessible pore size. 
In \textbf{Paper XI} the ZSM--5 acidity was modified by Ca incorporation.
Experimentally a reduction of the aromatics formation has been measured. To give
some molecular insight, periodic DFT calculations have been performed to
investigate the consequence of incorporating Ca into H--ZSM--5. CaOCaOH\ce{^+}
species are formed and may show multiple structures coordinated to the framework
oxygen atoms near the Al substitution. In the
paper it was demonstrated that CaOCaOH\ce{^+} moieties might replace the
original Br\o{}nsted acid sites and form Lewis acid sites, which were found to catalyze methanol
conversion. \textbf{Paper XI} was the onset of a more elaborate study which is
still going on, and in which various researchers of the CMM are involved (Dr.
Kristof De Wispelaere and Simon Bailleul). The project was initiated and
performed in the collaboration with the group of Prof. Jorge Gascon.
