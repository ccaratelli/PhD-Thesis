Catalysis, from Ancient Greek $\kappa\alpha\tau\acute{\alpha}$ (kat\'a = ``down'') and $\lambda\acute{\upsilon}\omega$ (l\'u\=o = ``loosen''), is at the heart of almost every industrially relevant chemical process. A catalyst intervenes in the reaction, allowing chemical species to come in contact and react with a specific mechanism, without being consumed. Outstanding catalysts do not only increase the rate of a given reaction, enabling processes that would not happen spontaneously, but can even be selective towards specific end products. Catalysts can be divided in homogeneous and heterogeneous, according to the phase where they are located with respect to the reactants. Homogeneous catalysts share the same phase with the reactants, and can be for instance molecules dissolved in a solvent, such as with organometallic compounds. These type of catalysts are used in many industrial processes, but have the drawback of being difficult to separate from the products, and in many cases separation is the most costly step in the catalytic cycle. For instance, in the case of biodiesel production, the recovery and purification of the products accounts for 60-80\% of the whole cost\cite{atadashi2011biodiesel}.
\npar
Heterogeneous catalysts, on the other hand, are located in a different phase with respect to the reactants, and for this reason they have the advantage of being easily separable from the reaction products. Especially green chemistry can widely benefit from heterogeneous catalysts, lowering the production costs and providing a viable alternative to petroleum \cite{chouhan2011modern}. Even if the name heterogeneous does not refer to a specific phase, industrially relevant heterogeneous catalysts are often in the solid phase. In order to exert their function, these materials must possess specific active sites that are easy to reach for the reactants, where these can adsorb, react, desorb, and ultimately diffuse back in the bulk to leave space for a new cycle. For these processes to occur, the number of active sites and the area of contact between the two phases (or surface area) must be sufficiently high, and reactants and products must be able to easily diffuse in the material. 
\npar
All the above mentioned properties can be found in nanoporous materials, which possess pores with a diameter of $<$100 nm, and and are extensively used in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. According to the classification by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) \cite{mcnaught1997compendium}, they can be differentiated on the basis of their pore size into microporous (pore size $<$2 nm), mesoporous (pore size between 2 and 50 nm) and macroporous (pore size $>$ 50 nm). Their pore structure provides them with an exceptionally high surface area, that for some materials can reach values larger than 7000 m$^2$/g \cite{farha2012metal, honicke2018balancing}. This facilitates diffusion of reactants inside the material, and allows shape selectivity to give specific products. Well-known classes of nanoporous materials include zeolites and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) \cite{liang2017heterogeneous}. Zeolites were one of first heterogeneous catalysts to be industrially exploited, and are the workhorses of petrochemistry, among other applications. They are extremely robust due to their inorganic nature and can withstand harsh reaction conditions. In contrast, MOFs are novel hybrid materials that are less robust, but extremely versatile. They possess even higher porosity, diverse composition, high metal content and tunable organic functions, and for these reasons they have a high catalytic potential. 
\npar
In general, the study of solid heterogeneous catalysts is not trivial, as the exact concentration and nature of the active sites is often unknown. It is not always clear, in fact, where exactly the active sites may be located in the material, and how they interact with molecules. Moreover, these materials are far from perfect, and are often the defects which are tremendously important to induce the catalytic properties. In this sense, molecular modeling offers a complementary platform, not only to understand the catalytic function, but also to determine structure--activity relationships and to design structures to target specific applications\cite{van2015advances}.
%The steady progress of industrial chemistry is tightly connected to the discovery of novel materials that can target specific applications. In this context, hybrid materials, such as MOFs represent a growing research field, where new applications are being explored.

\section{Metal Organic Frameworks}
MOFs are one of the most intriguing class of materials of current science. These materials, first called 'porous coordination polymers' (PCPs) were discovered in the late 50's, but only at the end of the past century with the works of Robson\cite{batten1995two,hoskins1990design}, Kitagawa\cite{kitagawa1991synthesis, kitagawa1993synthesis}, Yaghi\cite{yaghi1995hydrothermal} and F\'{e}rey\cite{riou1998hybrid}, the scientific community started to understand their full potential. At first the main focus of MOF research was in the discovery of new structures. However, in the last few decades, the field has seen an incredible explosion in scientific and industrial interest, with new applications being continuously explored\cite{furukawa2013chemistry}. MOFs are hybrid nanoporous materials that are composed by metal or metal--oxo clusters connected by multitopic organic linkers, to form multidimensional pore structures. Compared to the already well--known zeolites, MOFs can be constructed without templating agents, with a far greater number of metals and with an exceptional structural diversity. In fact, their particular building block design (Fig. \ref{fig:MOFs}), that makes use of secondary building units (SBUs), allows the creation of an almost infinite number of crystalline structures with different topology and chemical composition. The coordination bonds which lie at the basis of MOF structures are weaker than the inorganic zeolites. This on the one hand makes them less robust, but on the other allows facile structural modifications which are impossible to do on zeolites. In principle, the nature of the SBUs and their association can be finetuned\cite{stock2011synthesis}, allowing control of properties such as pore shape and size, functionalization, or surface area. The response to chemical and physical stimuli can this way be easily modulated \cite{zhou2014metal,zhou2012introduction}. 
One of the most intriguing concepts is the isoreticular synthesis, by which inorganic or organic SBUs can be replaced by topologically identical (or similar) building blocks. This way, starting from a given MOF precursor, whole families of MOF materials can be synthesized spanning a range of pore size and functionality. For instance, the pore size can be significantly increased up to the mesoporous range by using longer isoreticular linkers, such as in the IRMOF series, based on the MOF--5 precursor \cite{eddaoudi2002systematic}.

\npar
The tunability of MOF structures, along with their high crystallinity, metal content and porosity, are very appealing for application in different industrially relevant fields, such as catalysis, gas storage and separation, drug delivery or sensing, as displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:mof-applications}. More specific applications are being further explored, such as warfare agents decomposition, magnetic applications, or membrane separation \cite{furukawa2013chemistry}. 

\subsection*{Defects}
MOFs are crystalline materials, but they are not perfect, and possess structural disorder. Defect--containing MOFs have become an active field in MOF research, as defect sites can play a key role in the performance of the material. Following the classification proposed by Sholl \textit{et al.} \cite{sholl2015defects}, these defective sites in MOFs can be either point vacancies (such as missing linkers or clusters) or extended ones. Fang \textit{et al.} \cite{fang2015defect} further divide extended defects into dislocations, planar defects, and micro-- and mesoscale volume defects. 

\hl{Common experimental strategies for the characterization of defects in MOFs involve electron and fluorescence microscopy, Raman, infrared and X-ray spectroscopy, power and single--crystal X-ray diffraction.}
\npar
At low defect concentration, a random distribution of isolated point defects can be found, whereas at higher concentrations clustering could occur\cite{cliffe2014correlated}, if the presence of a vacancy is influenced by other vacancies in proximity. This complexity makes the study of defective sites and disorder a current challenge in MOF research. In particular, the control of their effect on specific properties is heavily limited if their location, type and dispersion are unknown. This randomness can be partially limited by judicious defect engineering during and post--synthesis. In order to identify and characterize defects in MOFs, it is particularly important to obtain atomic scale resolution on the defect sites and understand how they impact certain properties. 

\subsection*{MOFs as single site catalysts}
After the discovery of MOFs, with their tunability and ease in functionalization, the study of their application in catalysis followed naturally, and after adsorption was one of the earliest documented applications\cite{Fujita1994}. Their high porosity, in particular, allows chemical species to diffuse in the pores and access the active sites, and the high metal content offers the possibility to have many guest interactions sites. In this sense, provided the structures are stable at reaction conditions (i.e. no leaking is observed), MOFs can be considered true single--site heterogeneous catalysts, that contain well--defined active sites which are inherent part of the framework\cite{yang2019catalysis}. According to the classification proposed by Rogge \textit{et al.}, we can distinguish between three types of single--site catalysts in nanoporous materials, in which active sites for catalysis can arise from coordinatively unsaturated metals (type I), metal atoms embedded in porphyrin--based ligands (type II) or reactive functional groups (type III). \hl{Unsaturated metal sites of type I are the focus of this thesis. A plethora of MOFs has been synthesized possessing unsaturated metal sites within the pores which offer different Lewis acidity.}

\end{figure}
%
\subsection*{Post--synthetic modification}
When it is not possible to introduce functionalities with direct synthesis, post--synthetic modification (PSM) \cite{wang2009postsynthetic} has become a well established procedure that allows the preparation of MOF materials with specific chemical composition. Via this technique, it is possible to modify the crystal after the synthesis, allowing to finetune the properties of the material. Moreover, multi--functional sites can be integrated at the same time in the crystals \cite{li2016applications}. PSMs include encapsulation of guest molecules or nanoparticles in the pores, modifications of the linkers without breaking the metal--ligand bond, or post synthetic exchange (PSE) of linkers and metals, where building blocks are dynamically exchanged. PSE can also involve terminal ligands, or modulators, that do not contribute in connecting different bricks. This way, building blocks can be exchanged, but also eliminated to create vacancies, provided the material retains its stability. For this reason, PSM has been used as an efficient strategy to introduce defective sites in MOFs.  
%
\subsection*{Stability}
In general, to function at operating conditions, materials need to retain their thermal, mechanical and chemical stability at those conditions. For instance, mechanical stability is needed when compressing MOF in pellets or other shapes for industrial processes\cite{chapman2009pressure}, while chemical stability is crucial for any application, such as drug delivery, molecular separation, or catalysis\cite{horcajada2010porous}. Catalysis often also requires thermal stability, as the materials must be able to resist harsher conditions for certain processes such as in petrochemistry. However, the metal--ligand coordination bond that makes MOFs so tunable is also regarded as one of their main drawbacks\cite{keskin2010can, canivet2014water, kizzie2011effect}, as it is responsible for the lower structural stability when compared to already established nanoporous catalysts such as zeolites. For example, the first synthesized MOFs such as \ce{Cu2+} trimesate HKUST-1, or MOF-5, composed by \ce{Zn2+} clusters and BDC linkers were degraded by water even at mild conditions\cite{greathouse2006interaction, low2009virtual, kaye2007impact, decoste2013effect}. 
\npar
Following the nomenclature proposed by Kitagawa, we can differentiate between three generations of MOFs\cite{kitagawa1998functional}. First generation MOFs are defined as having a guest--molecules supported pore system that collapses when these are evacuated. For this reason, this first generation of MOFs found very limited use for practical applications. Those of second generation are more robust and have permanent porosity, that is retained even in absence of guest molecules. These materials show high potential for catalysis and other applications and are the main object of this dissertation. Finally, third generation MOFs are characterized by flexible pores that can reversibly change shape with the presence of guest molecules, or upon certain stimuli, such as temperature or pressure. Matsuka et al.\cite{matsuda2004guest} identified five types of response mechanisms in MOFs, denoted as shrinking, expanding, reshaping, swelling and gate opening or closing. A perspective on the types of stimuli that can induce responsive in MOFs has been reported in the work of Coudert \cite{coudert2015responsive}.



\subsection*{Zr--based MOFs}

\end{figure}
%%
Recently, a class of robust MOFs have been synthesized showing an unprecedented stability\cite{furukawa2014water}. Zr--based MOFs\cite{bai2016zr} which exploit the robustness of the Zr--O bond, show an outstanding stability and are at present time one of the most studied classes of MOFs. Moreover, zirconium is an ubiquitous metal that is present in biological systems and has low toxicity, as well as limited cost. This makes these materials particularly promising for applications in catalysis, gas sorption, and drug delivery. An overview of the plethora of possible structures that can be synthesized with different inorganic SBUs can be found in a recent review by Bai \textit{et al.} \cite{bai2016zr}.
\npar
The vast majority of these materials is characterized by Zr(IV) atoms in a high coordination state (Fig. \ref{fig:Zr-MOFs}), which interact strongly with the oxygens of carboxylate linkers of various topology. These MOFs are characterized by a \ce{Zr6O4(OH)4} cluster in which each of the 6 zirconium atoms is connected to 4 oxygen atoms (two $\mu_3$--OH and two $\mu_3$--O), each of which is in turn connected to three zirconium atoms, forming a polyhedron. Each zirconium atom can form 4 other bonds with ligands, accommodating up to 24 metal--ligand bonds per cluster. Every zirconium atom can therefore form a total of 8 coordination bonds oriented in a square--antiprismatic geometry, yielding a rich range of possible structures that can be synthesized with connectivity ranging from 12, as in UiO--66\cite{cavka2008new}, to 6 which is found in MOF--808\cite{furukawa2014water} (see Fig. \ref{fig:Zr-MOFs}). The dual Lewis acid/base nature of the Zr--carboxylate bonds, along with the high metal oxidation state, gives rise to strong interactions between the SBUs, thus allowing processes such as PSM without compromising the stability of the structures. The stability of Zr--based MOFs depends on the connectivity between the inorganic and organic SBUs, as well as the number of M--L bonds that are present in the structure \cite{bai2016zr}. However, open metal sites in these materials are present only when the connectivity of the linkers is less than 12. Zirconium atoms that remain undercoordinated in these materials are Lewis acid sites where reactants can adsorb and that can function as catalytic centers.

\subsection*{UiO--66}
The first material belonging to this class of Zr--based MOFs is the Zr--therephtalate based UiO--66, and was first synthesized at the Universiteit i Oslo (UiO) by Lillerud and coworkers\cite{cavka2008new}. This UiO-66 material is one of the most studied MOFs thus far and was an inspiration of other MOFs within this family. UiO--66 is characterized by an extremely high connectivity that gives rise to an exceptional structural stability. In this material, each \ce{Zr6} SBU is connected to 12 therephthalate (or benzenedicarboxylate (BDC)) linkers forming a cubic close packed structure with a space group F\={m}3m, No. 225. In this structure there are two different cavities of octahedral and tetrahedral shape, with window sizes of 10 \AA\ and 25 \AA, respectively. Each octahedral cage shares triangular windows with eight tetrahedral cages. 
This results in an extremely robust material which is stable up to 648 K and in a broad range of protic and aprotic solvents and pH conditions. Moreover, the \ce{Zr6O4(OH)4} bricks can be reversibly dehydrated upon thermal treatment at temperatures between 523 and 573 K. Up to two water molecules can be formed this way, yielding a \ce{Zr6O6} brick, where the zirconium atoms have a coordination of 7\cite{valenzano2011disclosing}. 
\npar
A whole family of isoreticular MOFs can be derived from UiO--66 by using linkers of different size, spanning from fumaric acid\cite{wissmann2012modulated} up to terphenyldicarboxylic acid\cite{schaate2011modulated}, allowing to significantly tune pore size and surface area. Interpenetrated MOFs with UiO--66 topology have been also reported if longer linkers are used\cite{schaate2011porous}, with a decrease in surface area. Moreover, different functional groups can be appended to the phenyl rings, such as bromo, amino, nitro, or naphthalene. Garibay and Cohen showed that UiO--66--\ce{NH2} can be further modified to yield new functionalized frameworks \cite{garibay2010isoreticular}. Also the inorganic SBUs can be modified, for instance introducing titanium or hafnium\cite{kim2012postsynthetic}. The exceptional thermal and chemical stability of UiO--66, along with its high connectivity, allows all these modifications of the structure, and for this reason, this material is often considered as a perfect MOF archetype, where new techniques can be tested.

\subsubsection*{Defects on UiO-66}
%chap 11 of book from Garcia
\td{revise this sentences}
The perfect crystalline UiO--66 structure, where every zirconium atom is 8--fold coordinated, does not possess undercoodinated Lewis acid sites available for catalysis. However, it became clear that the synthesized UiO--66 showed a behavior that deviated from the theory and pointed towards the presence of defective sites. Different indications of the presence of defects were observed, such as symmetry--forbidden reflections in the PXRD pattern, metal--linker ratio obtained by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), higher than expected surface area, appearance of O--H stretching bands in the FTIR spectrum etc. \cite{shearer2014tuned, valenzano2011disclosing}. It has been generally accepted that the material contains defects in the form of missing linkers or clusters (Fig. \ref{fig:defectiveuio}), and that these are not only naturally occurring during synthesis, but their number can easily be tuned by adapting the synthesis conditions, such as temperature and type of modulator\cite{wu2013unusual, shearer2016defect}.
\npar
Defects can influence the material properties to a large extent. The beneficial role of defects in UiO--66 has been explored in many applications such as gas storage and separation\cite{wu2013unusual, ren2014modulated}, sensing\cite{stassen2016towards}, drug delivery\cite{cunha2013rationale} and catalysis\cite{vermoortele2013synthesis, rogge2017metal}. 
\npar
The physical properties of defective UiO--66 differ according to the number of defects and their location, as has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally \cite{rogge2016thermodynamic, devos2017missing, cliffe2014correlated, borges2016proton}. A decrease in the connectivity in the structure will naturally lead to a decrease in stability of the material. However, the extremely high connectivity of UiO--66 allows the presence of numerous missing linkers or cluster without loss of crystallinity. 
In this context, Rogge et al. investigated the influence of all possible configurations of one to two linker vacancies on the stability of UiO-66. The equilibrium volume is not affected by such vacancies, however properties such as bulk modulus and loss--of--crystallinity pressure, which in turn influence the stability, are affected by the number and configuration of missing linkers \cite{rogge2016thermodynamic}. 
De Vos et al.\cite{devos2017missing} investigated the electronic properties for all possible configuration of defective UiO--66 with up to three missing linkers, showing that some configurations are energetically more stable than others, and that the number and position of missing linkers affect the band gap of the material. From these studies performed on small unit cells, it is already clear that the number of possible defective configurations can be extremely high, and it is still unclear to what extent such point defects are disordered in the material. A regular distribution of point defects that involve missing clusters can lead to different phases in the material, from fcu (non-defective), to bcu (missing linkers with open channels), reo (missing clusters) to scu (missing linkers and missing clusters). Missing clusters could in principle increase the catalytic activity of the material more than missing linkers due to the larger pore size. Recently, Cliffe et al. \cite{cliffe2014correlated} showed in a combined theoretical-experimental work that missing clusters on UiO-66(Hf) were correlated and formed nanodomains in the material, characterized by a reo phase. This work shed light into the complexity of modeling disorder in nanoporous materials. 

\subsubsection*{Active sites for catalysis in UiO--66}
One of the breakthroughs of MOF research was the discovery that UiO--66 could contain a high number of open metal sites. As reported earlier, active sites for catalysis in UiO--66 and other Zr--MOFs are present when the zirconium connectivity is decreased from its equilibrium value of 8. 
\npar
%active sites by defects
A first way to obtain coordinatively unsaturated zirconium sites is by creation of defects, in the form of missing linkers or clusters. The inherent vacancies in UiO--66 bring unsaturated zirconium Lewis acid sites\cite{wu2013unusual, shearer2014tuned, vermoortele2013synthesis, vandichel2015active, liu2016probing} and at the same time enhance the accessibility of the reactants to the active sites as the pore volume increases. The synthesis of defective UiO--66 can be tuned via modulators such as formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), that are competing with BDC linkers in binding to the inorganic SBU. 
Vermoortele et al. first showed in a dual computational--experimental study that the Lewis catalyzed cyclization of citronellal requires missing linkers\cite{vermoortele2012electronic}. For Meerwein reduction, another Lewis catalyzed reaction, the catalytic activity of UiO--66 could be significantly increased by making use of TFA, that introduced a large number of linker vacancies. Additionally, the non-modulated material that contained only a small number of defects showed nearly no catalytic activity\cite{vermoortele2013synthesis}. Such relationship between catalytic activity and amount of defects has been reported for different Lewis catalyzed reactions giving clear evidence that the catalytic centers are located on the defective sites\cite{vermoortele2012electronic, vermoortele2013synthesis}. 
\npar
The molecular characterization of the defective sites on UiO--66 has been an ongoing research interest in MOF literature. Lillerud and coworkers \cite{oien2014detailed} reported that when linker vacancies were present, XRD characterization of the material showed two type of Zr--bonded oxygen atoms. The first type was BDC oxygen, and the other was associated to water species coordinated to the zirconium on the defect site. Later from SXRD measurements, the group of Yaghi \cite{trickett2015definitive} proposed that the two Zr--bonded oxygens belonged to physisorbed water molecules and that the charge compensating species was a hydroxyl group. However, further work did not confirm such configuration. Molecular simulations were essential to shed light into the detailed molecular structure of the defective brick. Ling and Slater \cite{ling2016dynamic} performed MD simulations starting from the configuration proposed by Yaghi and showed a progressive stabilization towards another structure where the two adjacent zirconium atoms were coordinated to a physisorbed water molecule and a hydroxyl group, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:bronsted-lewis-uio}. These sites have been confirmed by a comprehensive computational study of different adsorption possibilities of up to three water molecules on defective UiO--66 performed by Vandichel et al. \cite{vandichel2016water} and by simulations performed in this work of thesis. 
Such water and hydroxy species are strongly interacting with the zirconium atoms and are sources of Br\o{}nsted sites, as indicated in Fig. \ref{fig:bronsted-lewis-uio}. It was remarkable to discover that some catalytic processes are not catalyzed by undercoordinated Lewis acid sites, but need also Br\o{}nsted sites arising from defect--coordinating species, as will be shown in \textbf{PAPER I}. Serre and coworkers reported that a hydrogen bonded network that spans the octahedral and tetrahedral cages is responsible for the high proton conductivity showed by UiO-66 at high temperatures \cite{borges2016proton}. Kitagawa et al. showed the positive role of defects in proton conductivity in the UiO-66 material, as defective sites provide both larger pores and zirconium undercoordinated sites where water species are adsorbed and can function as proton donors \cite{taylor2015defect}. Farha and coworkers identified three types of acidic protons in the material by means of potentiometric titration: $\mu_{3}$--OH belonging to the inorganic SBU, and two arising from subsequent deprotonation of the physisorbed water and hydroxyl group on the defective site. They made use of the acidic protons belonging to physisorbed water for a quantification of defects in the material \cite{klet2016evaluation}. The mechanism associated to the change in topology of the hydroxyl groups on the inorganic SBU has been investigated by Yang et al.\cite{yang2016tuning}. The interaction between defect--coordinating water molecules and zirconium atoms is strong, and UiO--66 can be partially hydrolized\cite{decoste2013stability} while retaining its stability, as will be further discussed in this dissertation.
\npar
The defect--coordinating species can be removed by thermal activation at T $>$ 423 K (more information on this process is given in \textbf{PAPER I}). The more loosely bonded physisorbed water is the first to leave the defective site, followed by the chemisorbed water. The dehydrated active site obtained this way is missing a $\mu_{3}$--OH proton and has two 7--fold coordinated zirconium open metal sites as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:bronsted-lewis-uio}. 
\npar
%active sites by dehydration
The second activation process by which open metal sites can be created on UiO--66 is the reversible dehydration of the \ce{Zr6O4(OH)4} cornestone to obtain \ce{Zr6O6} by removal of up to two water molecules performed at a temperature range between 523 and 573 K \cite{valenzano2011disclosing}. In this case also 7-fold coordinated zirconium atoms are created and may take the role as Lewis active sites, however the increase in pore size due to linker vacancies does not occur, and the active sites are less accessible than in the defective material. 
%The presence of these species give a dual Bronsted--Lewis catalytic nature to UiO--66.
%The electroneutrality of the structure makes it so that at least one negatively charged species has to be coordinated to the inorganic SBU.

	\label{fig:bronsted-lewis-uio}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Functionalization of UiO--66}
As anticipated earlier, the nature of the active sites can also be influenced by linker functionalization \cite{kandiah2010synthesis, kandiah2010post, kim2012discovery}. 
The presence of electron--donating substituents showed an increase in catalytic activity for jasminaldehyde condensation \cite{vermoortele2011amino}. A positive effect of electron--withdrawing group was found by the same authors for Lewis catalyzed citronellal cyclization \cite{vermoortele2012electronic}. The beneficial role of amino groups was reported as well by Timofeeva et al. \cite{timofeeva2014effects} for acetylisation of benzaldehyde, as well as by Cirujano et al \cite{cirujano2015zirconium, cirujano2015conversion} for esterification. The electron donating effect of amino groups would in principle lead to a decrease in the Lewis acidity of the defective zirconium atoms, lowering the reaction rate. Therefore, a change in mechanism in the presence of BDC--\ce{NH2} was hypothized. However, Hajek et al. further studied aldol condensation in a computational work\cite{hajek2015mechanistic}, and reported a beneficial, but passive role of amino groups, which is further confirmed in \textbf{PAPER I} for Fischer esterification. 

\subsection*{Active sites on MOF--808}
\begin{figure}[!htbp]

	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{MOF-808-dehydration}
	\caption{Schematic representation of as synthesized and upon activation MOF-808 structures}
	\label{fig:MOF-808-dehydration}
\end{figure}
MOF--808, formed by the inorganic \ce{Zr6O4(OH)4} cornestone and trimesate (BTC) linkers, represent the least connected MOF in the Zr--MOF family \cite{furukawa2014water}, and its brick can be regarded as an extreme case of the defective UiO--66. The rigid BTC tritopic linkers stabilize the structure and yield exceptionally wide channels which are required for the diffusion of substrates. The octahedral crystals contain 6 BTC linkers per inorganic node and are characterized by a \textit{spn} topology. 
In the material, each zirconium atom is bonded to four oxygens from the inorganic brick and two oxygens from the BTC linkers. The other two bonds that are needed to reach the total coordination of 8 are provided by species present in solution that do not contribute to the framework connectivity. 
\npar
In the as--synthesized material, the zirconium atoms are capped with the relative mobile formate modulator. The material at this stage does not contain catalytically active sites and must be activated by post--synthetic treatment. By hot filtration, the formate groups can be eliminated and replaced by water and hydroxyl groups. In the catalytically active material, each brick is connected to six BTC linkers, six water molecules and six hydroxyl groups, and possesses a high number of potential Br\o{}nsted sites. Klet et al. report the presence of four different types of protons in the material \cite{klet2016evaluation}. Lewis acid sites can be created by thermal activation, similarly as in UiO--66. In this case, hydroxyl groups remain connected to the zirconium atoms and the material possesses both Lewis and Br\o{}nsted sites. The hydroxyl groups could also be used as anchors to incorporate new features, for instance by molecular docking of a single-site catalyst to immobilize it on a MOF-scaffold. MOF--808 is a promising catalyst that is still less studied than UiO--66, but has a lot of potential for possible applications. For instance, it shows a higher catalytic activity for certain Lewis catalyzed reactions, such as Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction \cite{plessers2016zr, mautschke2018catalytic}. 
Moreover, MOF--808 represents the first evidence of a superacid in MOFs, showing superacidity after post--synthetic treatment with sulfuric acid \cite{jiang2014superacidity}.

\section{Outline and goal of the thesis}
In this chapter, the main characteristics of MOFs making them appealing for catalysis have been introduced, as well as the current challenges that MOF research is facing. The properties of catalytically active sites on defective UiO--66 and MOF--808 were studied by means of molecular modeling techniques. Molecular modeling can give fundamental insight into the properties of MOFs, and at present time a plethora of different techniques are available for this purpose. To model processes in MOFs, knowledge of both power and limitations of these methods and experimental insight into the scientific question are required to find the appropriate combination of techniques.\\
This PhD thesis is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item In Chapter 2, a condensed theoretical overview of current molecular modeling techniques within MOF research is given. Particular attention is drawn on how these techniques can be applied to obtain insight into structural and catalytic properties at operating conditions.
\item In Chapter 3, the main results of this PhD thesis are summarized. The links between theory and experiment are highlighted throughout the chapter. All results are the result of fruitful experimental and theoretical collaborations and have been published in international peer--reviewed journals. 
\item In Chapter 4, the main conclusions of this thesis work, as well as perspectives on future research are given.
\end{itemize}
